    <h1>I'm not certain what this part of the website is, I doubt it's anythign to do with A&H. Best to leave it alone<br> - Carl</h1>
    <h2>Completed Project</h2>
    <p>The ERP is completed. Higher ups want it shipped out for the 19th of September under the quise of a cruise. As usual, below is a report. The world is ours</p>
    <h2>Shift in deadline</h2>
    <p>With almost triple the profits from the new guy working tierlessly, boss wants the ERP done by 2018 now, instead of the original projection date of 2023. Makes sense, but a huge time crunch. As usual, report included below</p>
    <h2>Test Subjects</h2>
    <p>While the boss is hiring more people for the guise of the company, they've allowed us to start recruiting test subjects for testing the prototype. Â£400 a week should be enough to grab subjects needy, but the best part is most of them most likely won't live to see the end of week one, since we are playing with life and death itself. As usual, report is below</p>
    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <P>Finally, the ERP theory has a physical prototype. This needs testing though. Below is a report on the development, and we'll need confirmation from the boss to approve for </P>
    <h2>New Project</h2>
    <p>Aaron and Harris Becking approached us with some files their father was working on that they had discovered shortly after their father passed on. It seems to be a research paper with some theoretical blueprints, labelled simply as The Eternal Return Point or ERP for short. It seems interesting, a machine that takes DNA data and should allow you to always come back. We'll defiently accept this project, imagine the possibilities...</p>
